      <h2><span class="artNum">Section I</span> <span class="artTitle">PREAMBLE</span></h2>
      <section class="content"><p>The purpose of this Agreement is to reaffirm the parties’ common responsibility to maintain a collaborative and collegial collective bargaining relationship that furthers the parties’ shared goal of delivering high quality instructional programs and significantly advancing a well-rounded public education for the students of the Chicago public school system.  Through free and open dialogue, the parties have identified the educational objectives for the Chicago Public Schools (hereinafter referred to as “CPS”) and have designed this Agreement to further those objectives through good faith cooperation now and in the future.</p><p>The parties firmly believe that a well-rounded public education is an absolute necessity for any graduate to be considered college-, career- and citizenship-ready.  The parties also recognize that a well-rounded public education includes, but is by no means limited to, providing students with an enriched, diverse and comprehensive curriculum that allows them to obtain essential knowledge and skills; engage in critical and creative thinking; develop independent inquiry skills and an appreciation for the arts, music and literature; improve their physical and emotional health; prepare for leadership roles in their communities; attain the technical skills necessary to become career-ready; develop the academic discipline and proficiency in the intelligent use of technology necessary to become college-ready; and ultimately graduate from the Chicago public school system prepared to become productive and self-confident citizens capable of ethical participation in a free and democratic society.</p><p>In addition, the parties recognize that the achievement of these educational objectives requires substantial short- and long-term financial investments in public education and that the fulfillment of the aspirations described in this Preamble will require dramatic and cooperative changes in education funding at the federal, state and local levels; a commitment to good faith collaboration; mutual agreement on priorities and values; and the adoption of proven or research-based educational methods and instructional practices.</p><p>Furthermore, to foster a cosmopolitan spirit and better develop CPS students as tolerant and unbiased citizens, the BOARD and the UNION shall work affirmatively to the end that each student may have the educational advantage of an integrated school.</p><p>Finally, this Agreement is intended to affirm that the parties’ shared goals will only be achieved if bargaining unit employees are fairly and adequately recognized and rewarded for their contributions to the educational process and provided with a wholesome work environment based on mutual respect and the highest level of professionalism.  The guiding principles set forth in this Preamble shall remain at the forefront of the parties’ negotiations now and in the years to come until these shared educational aspirations become a reality for each and every student and employee of the Chicago public school system.</p></section>

The Joint Committee shall establish rules surrounding the use of local criteria in evaluation, and no local criteria shall be used or given weight until those rules are established. After a student survey pilot in school year 2013-2014, the Joint Committee shall also determine whether student surveys shall be used as a component of the teacher evaluation plan in school year 2014-2015 and thereafter.  Unless otherwise agreed by the Joint Committee, teacher practice scores shall be 75% of the summative rating in school year 2012-2013, 75% of the summative rating in school year 2013-2014 and 70% of the summative rating in school year 2014-2015.  Student growth scores shall be 25% of the summative rating in school year 2012-2013, 25% of the summative rating in school year 2013-2014 and 30% of the summative rating in school year 2014-2015.  Joint Committee meetings shall occur where possible during the regular school day.  Where necessary, members of the committee who are classroom teachers shall be provided with substitute teachers on meeting days.</p></li><li><p>The BOARD and the UNION shall conduct a joint study of the implementation of the teacher evaluation plan.

      <section class="content"><p>A teacher appeals process shall be established to contest certain summative ratings given by a qualified evaluator. It shall be comprised of a committee of four active or retired educators, two of whom shall be selected by agreement of the UNION President and the Chief Executive Officer, one of whom shall be selected by the UNION and one of whom shall be selected by the BOARD.  All members of the committee shall be qualified evaluators.  Both the BOARD and the UNION shall select qualified alternate committee members who may substitute for their regularly appointed members.  Individual members of the committee must recuse themselves from cases where they have personal familiarity with the teacher appealing a summative rating and will be replaced by the same appointing entity. The Joint Committee shall determine whether the appeals process exists after school year 2018-2019.</p><p>The following teachers will have right to appeal their ratings according to the timelines outlined in <a href="#art39-9">Article 39-9</a>.A:</p><ul><li>Teachers rated unsatisfactory</li><li>Tenured teachers receiving ratings in the lower half of developing</li></ul><p>The following teachers will have right to appeal their ratings if they are laid off out of order of seniority.  </p><ul><li>Teachers rated unsatisfactory</li><li>Teachers rated developing&nbsp;</li></ul><p>The time for appeal shall as set forth in <a href="#art39-9">Article 39-9</a>A and shall commence when the teacher receives a notice of layoff/displacement.

The teacher must also submit a copy of the appeal to the teacher’s principal or head administrator.  In the appeal, the teacher must state the factual basis for the appeal and identify the evidence that supports the appeal.   An appeal may be based on student growth ratings in whole or part only if the teacher identifies a data integrity or data analysis error.</p></li><li><p>Upon receiving an appeal, the appeals committee shall review the written record of the rating. The “written record of the rating” includes (1) the documents and materials submitted by the teacher to the evaluators during pre-conferences and post-conferences or at other times as evidence of the teacher’s practice and (2) the evaluator’s observations, comments and feedback.  The written record of the rating shall not include materials and evidence that the teacher or evaluator was not privy to during the rating process.</p></li><li><p>If the committee determines the written record of the rating to be insufficient to make a ruling, it shall schedule a meeting with the teacher at which the teacher shall be represented by the UNION and with at least one of the qualified evaluator-observers who contributed observation ratings to the teacher’s rating.  The meeting shall take place within ten school days of receipt of the appeal.</p></li><li><p>The BOARD shall provide the teacher and the UNION with all evidence used by the qualified evaluator to determine the summative rating under appeal five days prior to the meeting.</p></li><li><p>After reviewing the written record of the rating, the appeals committee shall have the right to meet with the teacher and to determine if a formal observation of the teacher appealing the rating shall take place to assist it in its determination.  If an observation does take place, the two jointly appointed appeals committee members must conduct the pre-observation conference in accordance with <a href="?art39-2.3#art39-2">Article 39-2.3</a>(C)(2), and the observation shall take place within five school days of the pre-observation conference.</p></li><li><p>After a review of the written record of the rating and any interview with the teacher and evaluator, and any observation, and following deliberation, the appeals committee may overturn the rating if three of its members conclude that the rating under review is erroneous.  If the appeals committee determines by majority vote that the teacher’s appeal is to be granted, the BOARD shall revoke the summative rating under appeal and issue the teacher an appropriate summative evaluation.  A different qualified evaluator shall be assigned to the teacher during the next school year who shall follow all applicable provisions of this Article.  No developing rating that results from a sustained appeal of an unsatisfactory rating shall count towards the two-developing rule.</p></li><li><p>An appeal shall not delay the commencement of a professional development plan or remediation plan.</p></li></ol></section>

If thirty days’ notice is not practicable (such as because of a lack of knowledge of approximately when a leave will be required to begin, a change of circumstances or a medical emergency), notice must be given as soon as practicable. Failure to provide the notice set forth in this Section shall not affect the employee’s entitlement to the leave when the BOARD has actual knowledge of the FMLA-precipitating event. </p><p> A bargaining unit employee who takes FMLA leave shall be entitled on return from such leave to be restored to the position of employment held by the employee when the leave commenced or to an equivalent position with equivalent employment benefits, pay and other terms and conditions of employment. </p><p> Except as may be specifically provided for in this Agreement, bargaining unit employees’ rights and obligations relating to FMLA leave shall be governed by the provisions of the FMLA (including the regulations thereunder) and BOARD rules or policies.</p></section>
